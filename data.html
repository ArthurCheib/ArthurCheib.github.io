        <h2>Freedom in the World Index</h2>
        <p>In this exploratory data analysis, the analyzed dataset is the Freedom in the World Index, a reputable data set developed by Freedom House. The goal was to better understand global trends in Freedom and democracy over the 21st century. Various statistical and visualization tools were utilized to illustrate the dynamics of freedom scores across the years. The analysis focused on established democracies, incorporating both cross-sectional and longitudinal data to provide an in-depth understanding of changes over time. 

          The data revealed an unexpected trend: Freedom has steadily declined in stable democracies throughout the 21st century. Several indicators of Freedom, including political rights and civil liberties, have experienced a downward trajectory in countries typically regarded as bastions of democracy. The data suggests that this trend is not a temporary anomaly but a persistent pattern, posing serious questions about democratic values and institutions in the contemporary world. Further research is required to understand the underpinnings of this decline and identify potential measures to reverse it.
