        <h2>Freedom in the World Index</h2>
        <p>The analyzed dataset is the Freedom in the World Index, a reputable data set developed by Freedom House. The goal was to better understand global trends in Freedom and democracy over the 21st century. The data revealed an unexpected trend: Freedom has steadily declined in stable democracies throughout the 21st century. Political rights and civil liberties have experienced a downward trajectory in countries typically regarded as bastions of democracy. The data suggests that this trend is not a temporary anomaly but a persistent pattern.

        <h2>EPPGG Career Analysis</h2>
        <p>The dataset analyzed can be found in the "Portal da TransparÃªncia", a platform for open government data in Brazil. We aim to discover the determinants of salaries within a major bureaucratic career in Minas Gerais. The study employed a regression on observables to dissect the effects of factors such as time in service, education level, and job role. The findings elucidated that 'time in service' emerged as the most influential determinant of the salary structure. However, an equally intriguing insight was the pronounced effect of securing positions of trust early in the career.
